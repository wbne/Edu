<p>Macrophage - Kills enemies. Its secondary functions are activting cells, communicating, and causing inflammation.</p>
<p>Neutrophiles - Crazy killing machine. It kills both friend and foe. Will commit suicide a few days afterwards to prevent collateral damage.</p>
<p>Dendritic Cells - Determines what kind of threat is attacking the body. Once it determines it, then it will activate T-Cells in the nearest lymph node.</p>
<p>Helper T-Cells - Keeps other cells active. Recieves genetic code from dendritic cell and creates memory helper T-Cells, T-Cells that attack, and messenger T-Cells which travel to the B-Cells.</p>
<p>B-Cells - The anti-biotic factory that targets one specific threat. Disables threat as the anti-biotics travel through the blood. During this process, memory B-Cells are created in case the threat appears again.</p>

<h3 id = "fancytitle2">How the Immune System Functions*</h3>
<p> Once the bacteria passe through your skin, they will multiply until your body notices the threat.</p>
<p> Macrophages nom bacteria and send signals to release water, causing inflammation.</p>
<p> If the threat is too severe, the macrophage sends a messenger protein to the neutrophiles to move into the region of war.</p>
<p> The brain gets involved as the neutrophiles fight, sending dendritic cells which rip the threat and apply it to its outer layer. Here, the dendritic cell determines if the threat is a bacterial infection or a viral infection and for this example, it is a bacteria. They then travel to the nearest lymph node.</p>
<p> When the dendritic cell reaches the helper T-Cells in the lymph node, it transmits the information of the threat to the T-Cell. Once this happens, the T-Cell clones it self creating three groups.</p>
<li>The first group makes sure the the macrophages and neutrophiles stay active when they are fighting the infection.</li>
<li>The second group turns into memory T-Cells, which will remember the specific threat forever.</li>
<li>The final group will travel to the B-Cells to activate and keep them operating.</li>
<br>
<p> Once the B-Cell revives the data of the threat, it will produce memory B-Cells and a specific anti-biotic to neutralize the bacteria and rendering them useless. Sending the anti-biotic through the blood, it turns the tide of the fight as the macrophages nom up the invaders.</p>
<p> After the battle is over, most cells commit suicide to preserve energy. However, memory B and T Cells remain in case the threat appears again, then the B-Cells blast anti-biotics until the bacteria dies from overdose or something.</p>
