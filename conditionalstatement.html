<br>
<p>Conditional statements are pretty simple. Take a look at this example</p>
<br>
<p><em>If this apple is bright purple, then it is not safe to eat.</em></p>
<p>This is a conditional statement. As the name would suggest, it is a statement with a condition.</p>
<br>
<p><em>If this apple is <b>not</b> bright purple, then it <b>is</b> safe to eat.</em></p>
<p>The sentence above is a inverse statement, where you can tell what's going on.</p>
<br>
<p><em>If it <b>is</b> safe to eat, then this apple is <b>not</b> bright purple.</em></p>
<p>Notice how the condition is switched and reversed. This is a contra-positive statement.</p>
<br>
<p><em>This is not safe to eat <b>if and only if</b> the apple is bright purple.</em></p>
<p>This is a biconditional statement. It doesn't matter which order it's in.</p>
<br>
<p>All of the conditional statements can be false!</p>
<p>Using the power of logic, may you live in interesting times!</p>
