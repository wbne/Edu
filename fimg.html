<h3 id = "fancytitle2">Basic Overview</h3>
<p>There are four basic groups that are obviosly necessary for you to like live and stuff...</p>
<p>Here are the four groups</p>
<p id = "quellanger">Carbohydrates</p>
<p id = "quellanger">Protein</p>
<p id = "quellanger">Lipids</p>
<p id = "quellanger">Nucleaic Acid</p>
<br>
<p>They each have their own unique functions and are found in different types of foods</p>

<p>Note that this page is a simplification, but it's good enough to get by in AP Bio.</p>

<h3 id = "fancytitle2">Carbohydrates</h3>
<p>Carbohydrates, the food that adds yum value to every meal!</p>
<p>While it may be tasty, it can also kill you but you would have to be very special to accomplish this task...</p>
<p>The main thing about carbohydrates is that they have a lot of energy because they are just polysaccharides*.</p>
<p>Your body has many enzymes like maltase that can break the carbs down into something your body can use!</p>
<br>
<p>Some smart people may be wondering, why can I not eat grass then? Isn't it just a bunch of glucose stranded together? Isn't that what glycogen is?</p>
<p>While that is true, cellulose is over-powered as the bonds between the glucose molecules are flip flopped. (fig 1)</p>

<br>
<p>There are many forms of carbohydrates, the most well-known, especially if you are in 7th grade, is glucose whose molecular formula is C6H12O6.</p>
<p>While glucose is the most-well known, most kinds of carbohydrates are in more complex strands with many different types of sugars and configurations of sugars, making it difficult to extract the sugars your body wants and needs.</p>
<p>Because carbohydrates are basically just sugars connected to eachother, they contain a plethora of energy, which is why crazy people try to avoid carbs in order to lose weight.</p>
